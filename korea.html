            South Korea,[c] officially the Republic of Korea (ROK),[d] is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; though it also claims the land border with China and Russia.[e] The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan.
